             <summary>
             The UnhandledExceptionTrapper() method sets up a system-wide
             exception trapper that will catch all exceptions that
             occur after the code execution enters the Main() method.
             The errors will be displayed in the console output
             window and the application will let the user know that
             it will exit.
